== Expectations, Hopes, Fears: 

. This course is hands on. 
. We have half as many systems as we do people, so we will work in pairs. 
.. After the install, you will create your own orgs and spaces
... So your pairs, and tennants. 

. We will try not to kill you with power point
. We will intentionally break things
. Zach, Merlin and Josh will be here to help, just shout
.. Also, use your colleauges for help, we leave, they don't.
