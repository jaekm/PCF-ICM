= Remote Debugging

== Goal

Remote debugging is not a supported (easy) feature in Cloud Foundry.  However, in this exercise we will follow a procedure developed by Daniel Mikusa to enable remote debugging in STS.

== Exercise

*We cannot complete this exercise on the network*

. Follow the link:http://mikusa.blogspot.com/2014/08/debugging-java-applications-on.html[instructions] to enable remote debugging of your microservice.

. Verify this is set up correctly by placing a breakpoint in your code.
