= Application Log Draining

In this section, you will configure application log draining into a log analysis tool.  We will use the free Papertrail logging service, but any tool that supports tcp syslog draining can be used.

== How it Works

. Review the log draining documentation here: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/log-management.html

== VMware vRealize Log Insight 

. Create a user provided service for the app to drain its log into `cf cups my-logsvc -l syslog://192.168.5.250:514`

. Be sure to add your new User Provided Service to your microservice manifest.

. After you have bound and restarted your microservice, perform a few curl requests and ensure logs are draining into Log Insight.

=== Evaluation

. Review the details on log formats: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#format

. How do you see only logs related to application staging?

. How can you view logs for a specific application instance?

. Why didn't you have to add an application security group rule?

. How would you prevent log draining to an external service?


== Other External Tools

Many tcp syslog compliant log tools can be used with CloudFoundry.  A few popular tools are:

. VMware vRealize Log Insight
. Splunk Enterprise
. Logstash w/ Elastic Search & Kibana
