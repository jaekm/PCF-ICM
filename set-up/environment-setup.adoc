= Instructor set up

This directory contains artifacts and instructions to set up for new classes.

== Environments

Follow this guide to create a new environment or reset an existing environment.

=== Resetting

You can pick and chose which components to reset or completely wipe out everything (except ESXi) and start over.  Your call.

To completely reset, first log into vSphere through the client (not vCenter) and  delete all VMs.

== Initial Set up

=== vSphere

==== Add the SSD

If only datastore1 shows up, add the SSD datastore.

* Log into vSphere through the client

* Highlight the host > Configuration > Storage > Add Storage

* Name it `ssd`


==== Add the NFS Share

In the vSphere Client

* Highlight the host > Configuration > Storage > Add Storage

* Select "Network File System"

* Server: 209.236.122.183

* Folder: /volume1/share

* Name: share


==== Networking

There is a script in the vSphere directory to set up networking.  You need the vSphere cli to run this.

You can also set up networking manually if you don't want to go through the cli install.  Please be sure to set it up the same way though. Alternatively you can use the Docker image of the CLI and alias the commands. See https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/krujos/vsphere-cli/

To run the script:

* Install the vSphere CLI: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VCLI550&productId=352

* Edit the env-config.sh script for the environment you are setting up.

* Run the vsphere/networking.sh script


=== pfSense

==== Deploying pfSesnse

In vSphere:

* Create a new VM
+
** Select `Custom`
** Name: pfSense
** Datastore: datastore1
** Virtual Machine Version: 8
** Guest OS: Other > FreeBSD 32 bit
** CPU: Defaults are fine
** Memory: 1GB
** Network: Connect 2 NICS, LAN & WAN, Adapter Type: Flexible
** Other defaults are fine
** Select "edit config settings" before creating
** CD/DVD Drive > Datastore ISO > Point to the ISO on the `share` datastore.  Make sure you select `Connect at power on`

* Open the console

* Start the VM

* Option 1

* Hit `I` when prompted to start the install.  Capitalization counts.
+
** Configure Console: Accept these settings
** Select Task: Quick/Easy Install
** Confirm it
** Install Kernel: Standard Kernel
** Reboot: Return to Select Task
** Select Task: Exit
** Shut it down
+

* Ctrl + click on the pfSense VM > Edit Settings > CD/DVD drive > Unselect `Connect at power on`

==== Configuring pfSense

* Start the VM

* In the Console:
+
** Do you want to configure VLANs now: N
** Enter WAN interface name: Select the NIC on the WAN network (available by Ctrl + click on the VM > Edit Settings )
** Enter LAN interface name: Select the NIC on the LAN network (available by Ctrl + click on the VM > Edit Settings )
** Enter the Optional 1 interface name: leave blank
** Do you want to proceed: Y

* 2) Set interface(s) IP address: configure the IP4v addresses for both WAN and LAN
+
** Select option 2 from the "welcome" table
** Netmask should be 255.255.255.0 (bit count 24)
** WAN gateway should be the same as the pfSense IP except ending in `.1` (example 209.236.122.1)
** Do you want to revert to http as the Web Configurator protocol: N
** LAN IP should be 192.168.5.1
** LAN gateway should be blank.
** Do you want to enable the DHCP server on LAN: y
*** start address: 192.168.5.10
*** end address: 192.168.5.245
+

* 14) Enable SSH access

* 8) Shell out (option 8) and run the following to allow you to configure the pfSense box from an external (non-LAN) browser and ssh:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ easyrule pass wan tcp any <pfsense-wan-ip> 443
$ easyrule pass wan tcp any <pfsense-wan-ip> 22
----
+

* Open a browser: https://pfsense-wan-ip and login w/ the default user and pwd: admin/pfsense

* Follow the set up wizard
+
** DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
** You do not need to change anything on the WAN and LAN config screens as you have already done this.
** Set the admin password according to the spreadsheet

===== PCF Config

Set up the following rules using scripts:

* SSH to the pfSense box:

* Edit the pfsense/setenv.sh script for the correct WAN IPs and run it (cut & paste into your ssh session)

* Run the pfsense/rules.sh script to set up NAT WAN & LAN rules (cut & paste into your ssh session)


Set up the following rules through the web UI (assume defaults unless specified):

====== Firewall > NAT > 1:1

[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=======
| External IP     | Internal IP | NAT Reflection
| Jumpbox WAN IP  | 192.168.5.2 | enable
| OpsMgr WAN IP   | 192.168.5.3 | enable
| HAProxy WAN IP  | 192.168.5.5 | enable
|=======


====== Firewall > Virtual IPs

[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=======
| Virtual IP Address | Interface  | Type
| OpsMgr_WAN_IP/24   | WAN        | IP Alias
| HAProxy_WAN_IP/24  | WAN        | IP Alias
| JumpBox_WAN_IP/24  | WAN        | IP Alias
|=======


====== System > Advanced > Firewall / NAT

* NAT Reflection mode for port forwards > Enable (Pure NAT)

* Enable NAT Reflection for 1:1 NAT > checked

* Enable automatic outbound NAT for Reflection

* Save


=== vCenter

==== Installing vCenter

* Log into vSphere through the client.

* File > Deploy OVF Template
+
** The OVA is available on S3: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pcf-immersion/VMware-vCenter-Server-Appliance-5.5.0.20200-2183109_OVF10.ova
** Use datastore1 (the non-ssd)
** Deploy to the WAN Network

==== Configure vCenter

* In vSphere > vCenter VM > Console
+
** Login w/ root/vmware
** run `/opt/vmware/share/vami/vami_config_net` to configure networking
+
Save yourself the timeout headaches and configure in the following order:
** Option 6) IP Address: <FROM THE SPREADSHEET>
+
Config IPV6 address: No
+
Configure an IPv4 address for eth0: Y
+
Use a DHCPv4 server: n
+
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
** Option 4) DNS: 8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4
** Option 2) IPv4
+
Default gateway: <SAME AS THE VCENTER IP EXCEPT .1>
+
IPv6 Gateway: <leave blank>

* In a browser, navigate to https://<VCENTER_IP>:5480
+
** Log in w/ default pwd: root/vmware
** Accept EULA
** Config w/ default settings
** Admin > Change PWD pa15field

==== Set PCF Elements

* Use the vSphere client to log into vCenter

* Create a datacenter: Pivotal

* Create a cluster: PCF

* Add your vSphere (ESXi) host to the cluster.


=== Jumpbox

This process takes a long time b/c of the jumpbox size.  However, it is not too manual, so let's take the little victory.  There is a template on the share datastore which we will use.

* Log into vCenter through the vSphere client.

* Inventory > Datastores & Clusters

* In left panel, open up Pivotal DataCenter > share > CTRL + Click > Browse Datastore > JumpBox-Template

* CTRL+Click on JumpBox-Template.vmtx > Add to Inventory
+
** `Discovered Virtual Machines` folder
** PCF cluster
** Accept the rest of the defaults

* Inventory > VMs & Templates

* CTRL+Click on the JumpBox-Template > Deploy Virtual Machine from this Template
+
** Name: JumpBox
** Inventory Location: Discovered virtual machine
** Cluster: PCF
** Storage: datastore1
** Check `Power on this virtual machine after creation`
** Accept other defaults

* How about a Fresca?  This is going to take a while...

When it is complete...

* Start the new JumpBox VM

* Log in through the vCenter console

* Windoze is dumb... so select "Home Network" when that pops up.

* You should be good to go now.  Verify by using Remote Desktop Connection to connect to it.
