= Service Brokers

== Goal

In this section, students will deploy a custom service broker.

. The haash-broker implements a HashMap as a Service

. Deploy the Service Broker as an app to Cloud Foundry

. Register the Broker with the Cloud Controller

. Make the single plan in the catalog “public”

. Create an instance of your service

. Push and bind a test app to your service instance

. Test the app’s interaction with the service


== Exercise

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/[Creating Custom Services]

=== Overview

The Service Broker for this lab is for a service called HashMap as a Service (HaaSh). It wraps a minimal REST API around a Java HashMap implementation, and each service creation event results in a newly allocated Map.

=== haash-broker
* Download the hash broker
** https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pcf-icm/haash-broker.jar
* Push the broker as an app to CF.  Use the name: <first-initial><last-initial>-haash-broker

* Register the broker with the cloud controller:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf create-service-broker ...
----
+
The username & password you need for the broker are warreng/natedogg (regulate!)

* Next, you need to make the plan public:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf enable-service-access ...
----
+
You will need to figure out the plan name.  You can do this by accessing your service broker's catalog from a browser or the cli. <broker url>/v2/catalog and look for name in the services array ("HaaSh")

* Verify you can see your new service in the marketplace.  There is a cf command for this

* Create a new instance of your service using the CF commands.  Name the instance <first-initial><last-initial>-haash-service.

=== Haash Client

* Create a manifest for your haash-client.

* Be sure to connect the haash-client to the service instance you created above.

* Download the haash-client from S3.
** https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pcf-icm/haash-client.jar

* Push the haash-client to cf and name it: <first-initial><last-initial>-haash-client

* Curl your haash client to be sure it is working and using your haash-service
+
You can add key,value pairs using:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl <your haash-client>/HaaSh/<key> -d '<some value>' -X PUT
----
+

* You can retrieve the values:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl <your haash-client>/HaaSh/<key>
----
+


== Beyond the class

There are many community resources to help you build your own more robust service broker.

* Spring developers can use the link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-boot-cf-service-broker[Spring Boot CF Service Broker]
* PCF Needs additional data to make the console show your service see link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#example-broker-response[catalog metadata] in the docs.

* You following repositories can be used as a reference:
