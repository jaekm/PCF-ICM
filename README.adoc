== Material Format Philosophy

* Presentations introduce concepts.  They do not provide detail and never reformat the same content available on the docs site as bullets.  I bullets are boring and instead I favor animation.  Well rehearsed animation illustrates and explains concepts with very few words (see Onsiâ€™s talk on Diego at CF Summit).

* Docs are for detail.  I want students to get in the habit of reading and referring to the docs site.  I added open book "quizzes" to the curriculum to ensure they do this while going through the class.

* Asciidoc docs in git define the course, links and work.  They are easy to edit, format and navigate.
